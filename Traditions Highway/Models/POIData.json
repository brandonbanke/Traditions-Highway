Visit the preserve to hike its trails, though, and its name takes on a whole different meaning, one that perfectly encapsulates the ethereal beauty of the 4,426-acre wilderness. Old-growth longleaf and slash pines rise to guard the misty waters of the Altamaha River as it carves through cypress and tupelo swamps. Sunshine filters through dogwoods and basket oaks, tossing light and shadows onto fallen leaves. The sounds of nature are constant: the low call of wild turkeys, the echo of red-cockaded woodpeckers at work and the wind in the high canopy of longleaf pines.",

The addition of intricate ironwork and statuary in the 19th century enhanced the cemetery's natural landscape plan. The cemetery was purchased in 1855 by the city of Athens when further burials were prohibited in the old town cemetery on land owned by the University of Georgia. In 1856, the city formed a self-perpetuating Board of Trustees to hold and manage in trust the original purchase of 17 acres on the west side of the North Oconee River as a public cemetery for the benefit of the town. The grassy and rolling terrain with woods, flowing water and scenic vistas makes Oconee Hill a pleasant place to visit and stroll among the graves of many notable Georgians including governors, University presidents, veterans, and Congressmen. Oconee Hill is still an active cemetery, and lots are available for sale. Tours, picnics and outings are allowed with the approval of the cemetery staff.",
